This is a university project made by Laszlo Timar for (and only) demonstration purposes.
The time is very limited and it is also not in the requirements to be really enjoyable and useful, it serves as a proof of knowledge that I can use Android Studio, Java combined with a Database and API calls.

Used in this project:
- Android gravity sensor
- FireBase database
- FireBase Google Authentication
- Picasso (for easier image handling)
- Googe AdMob
- Netlify for storing the mazes in the cloud (for free and not in the FireBase JSON database)

Functions:
- authentication
- play several mazes
- see the leaderboard
- customize your game with custom color templates
- ads
